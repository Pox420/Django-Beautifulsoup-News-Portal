0,The accidental archiver,https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,"On his journey to become a sports photojournalist, Shyam Chitrakar accidentally curated possibly the largest—and most probably the only—sports archive in the country. ","A cupboard full of old VHS tapes. Dusty piles of negatives stacked on top of each other in a corner. A rusty brown chest with four drawers filled with audiovisual cassettes. An old TV and VHS player in the company of three LCD desktops. These sit silently in a dimly lit room in Shyam Chitakar’s office in Bagbazar, as the hustle and bustle in the streets continue outside.“There are thousands of photos and videos here from the first national game in 1982 to every South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) Championship and South Asian Games (SAG) to date. I start getting dizzy if I keep looking at all of this,” Shyam Chitrakar said as he points at the stack of VHS tapes on the cupboard. At 80, Chitrakar considers his sports archive content his life’s most prized possession. He began documenting the Nepali sports scene in the 1970s—and continues doing so to date. He had a peculiar habit of capturing moments and swiftly storing them away in cassette tapes and reels, he said. But little did he know this habit of his would someday make the largest—and most probably the only—sports archive in the country.“I am an accidental archiver. It just happened,” he chuckled as he sat down for this interview on a Sunday afternoon. “As my collection grew, I realised that the archive could serve a purpose in the future. Then I started preserving my works.”A sports photojournalist by profession, Chitrakar began his career as a footballer for the Mahabir Club.He was one of the few people during those days to have a video camera. He would occasionally click photos and videos. But back then, there were few photography workshops or classes so people usually learnt the technical know-hows through guidance from other established photographers. Chitrakar credits Nepal’s first cinematographer and his brother-in-law, the late Bakhat Bahadur Chitrakar, for guiding him and teaching him photography skills. “I did not receive any formal training. I learned everything from my brother-in-law. It was a learning-by-doing situation,” he said.After retiring from football in 1985, he got an offer to work for Nepal Television (NTV). “I was the first cameraperson for the NTV. We got to cover the King Birendra's visit to Australia and broadcast it instantly for the audience in Nepal for the first time,” Chitrakar recalled. Chitrakar started doing sports photography and videography for Nepal Television simultaneously. Over the years, he covered various subjects—from politics to lifestyle to sports. And he has archived most of his works. “If our future generation wants to watch Hora Prasad Joshi’s interview, I have it. Or any of Sharad Chandra Shah’s sports-related activities. Or interviews of Sita Rai or Baikuntha Manandhar—Nepal’s three-times gold medalist in the SAG. I have interviews and activities of almost all Nepali Olympic athletes such as Deepak Bista and Sangina Baidya,” said Chitrakar. Joshi served as home minister in the BP Koirala government in the late 1950s. He later was involved in drafting King Mahendra’s constitution in 1962 after the 1960 royal coup. Shah served as the chair of the National Sports Council. As a former athlete himself, Chitrakar believes that the media can bring the stories and triumphs of athletes to the limelight, which he believes will inspire and motivate them. He fondly recalls an incident when he read a news article about his football skills in Gorkhapatra when he was still an active athlete. “Players like Komal Pandey [one of the veteran sportspersons of Nepal] and Achyut Krishna Kharel [former inspector general of Nepal Police] were big names back then. I was taken aback to see my name along with theirs in the paper. The article described how I dodged my opponents and won accolades from the audience. It inspired me,” he said with a faint smile. "
1,"Covid jabs to be given from over 16,000 immunisation centres across the country",https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,Public health experts say authorities should launch a door-to-door campaign to immunise the unvaccinated population against the coronavirus. ,"As the deadline to immunise all eligible people comes closer, the Ministry of Health and Population has decided to administer Covid-19 vaccine from over 16,000 immunisation centres throughout the country.The decision of the ministry also aims to address problems related to storage of vaccines by administering more doses at the earliest.“We will administer Covid-19 vaccines from over 16,000 vaccination centres throughout the country,” Birodh Khatiwada, minister for health and population, told the Post. “I have directed all agencies concerned to start preparations accordingly.”The ministry said over 16,000 immunisation centres, which are being used for childhood immunisation, will be used for Covid-19 vaccination.Minister Khatiwada said that the vaccination services will start from next week.“I am in Hetauda right now and I am also inaugurating a vaccination centre,” said Khatiwada.Besides the immunisation centres, vaccination booths will also be set up in all community schools of 57 districts to administer Moderna vaccine to children between 12 and 17 years old.The ministry has decided to provide Moderna vaccine received from the COVAX facility, the United Nations backed international vaccine sharing scheme, to the children of the said age group from December 20.Nepal on Thursday received 719,000 doses of Janssen vaccine developed and manufactured by Johnson & Johnson from the COVAX facility.It is part of the 2.17 million doses of Janssen vaccine provided by the German government through COVAX.The second consignment of the remaining doses is scheduled to arrive on Friday, the Ministry of Health and Population said.“We have received 719,000 doses of the Janssen vaccine from the COVAX facility,” Dr Surendra Chaurasia, the chief of the Logistic Management Section under the Department of Health Services, told the Post. “The second consignment is scheduled to arrive tomorrow [Friday].”Nepal appears to be on track to vaccinating all its eligible population, as vaccines are arriving in huge numbers, as supply of more doses have become certain.Officials said that due to the huge supply of the doses they are facing logistical issues, including storage.Officials said that the government has communicated to COVAX and other vaccine providers to delay shipments. An official at the Department of Health Services, who did not wish to be named, said: “If all the vaccines that are in the pipeline come at once, we will face storage problems.”Public health experts have said that authorities concerned should launch a door-to-door campaign to increase the vaccination pace and immunise those who have been deprived of the vaccine due to various reasons. “Until now, we have been asking the people to come for vaccination at certain immunisation centers,” said Dr GD Thakur, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “The same strategy is not going to work if the government wants to increase the vaccination coverage. Health authorities should change strategy and visit every household to ascertain if any eligible person has missed the jab.”Over 51,000 female community health volunteers, social workers, local clubs, area development committees, teachers and others could be mobilised to inoculate the unvaccinated, according to Thakur.Experts warned that if the government doesn't change the strategy, the risk of wastage of millions of doses of vaccines will grow. Moreover, the government’s aim of inoculating all eligible people by mid-April will also not be met.“By using the available doses, we can effectively prevent another possible new wave of the pandemic as well as loss of lives,” said Dr Keshab Deuba, a public health epidemiologist. “When we have sufficient doses, human resources and unvaccinated people, why not make an extra effort to immunise all eligible population.”So far, Nepal has received 29.73 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines—Vero Cell, AstraZeneca, Janssen, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.Nepal launched its Covid-19 vaccination campaign on January 27 with 1 million doses of Covishield vaccine gifted by India. Covishield is the AstraZeneca type vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. The Health Ministry said that 9,468,489 people (31.2 percent of the total population) have been fully vaccinated as of Thursday.Nepal needs to vaccinate around 78 percent of its over 30 million estimated population, or around 25 million people, as per the government’s new plan that includes vaccinating those aged between 12 and 18 years.Earlier, the government had planned to vaccinate only those aged 15 years and above.

2,Shrines rebuilding handed over to Archaelogy Department,https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,The National Reconstruction Authority was carrying out the reconstruction work of earthquake-ravaged monasteries in Gorkha before its dissolution in mid-November. ,"Work to reconstruct five historic monasteries damaged by the 2015 earthquakes in Gorkha has been handed over to the Department of Archaeology after the dissolution of the National Reconstruction Authority in mid-November.The earthquake had damaged 104 monasteries in Gorkha. The National Reconstruction Authority was established to carry out the reconstruction of those infrastructures damaged by the devastating earthquake.According to Nabaraj Adhikari, chief at the Monasteries Reconstruction Project in Gorkha, the project implementation unit of the National Reconstruction Authority in Gorkha had been carrying out the reconstruction of the five monasteries until it was dissolved in mid-November. “Rs 60 million amount has been released to each monastery. The Department of Archaeology will continue the reconstruction work from now onwards,” said Adhikari.The reconstruction and repair work of Kangur Lhakhang and Pungchi monasteries of Chumnubri Rural Municipality-2 and Chhekam, Kaning and Tashi Chholing monasteries of Chumnubri Rural Municipality-4 is now under the Department of Archaeology.“We have conducted field visits to the monasteries. Three of the monasteries need complete reconstruction while two others have to be repaired. All these monasteries are more than 100 years old and carry religious and archaeological significance,” said Adhikari. According to him, the reconstruction and repair work of four monasteries will begin soon while the reconstruction work on Kangur Lhakhang monastery was initiated in the last fiscal year. However, officials at the Monasteries Reconstruction Project have expressed dissatisfaction with the ongoing reconstruction work at Kangur Lhakhang monastery. “The monastery is not being reconstructed in its traditional style. We found modern construction materials being used to restore the building. We have informed the Department of Archaeology about it,” said Adhikari. “Reconstruction and repair works on three other monasteries will begin soon. Efforts are underway to invite bidding and complete work on these three monasteries within the current fiscal year,” said Adhikari. Meanwhile, the reconstruction of Pungchi monastery has already been completed.“I hope the Department of Archaeology will reconstruct and repair the historic monuments in their original style,” said Adhikari.The 2015 earthquake with its epicentre at Barpak of Gorkha damaged more than 100 monasteries in the district. The reconstruction and repair of 13 monasteries have been completed so far while work on 91 others is yet to gather momentum.The National Reconstruction Authority initiated the reconstruction and repair of 50 monasteries in the fiscal year 2018-19. But the work could not take off due to a shortage of budget. The local people and other stakeholders have demanded that the authorities concerned reconstruct and repair the historic monasteries at the earliest.The 2015 earthquake also damaged several other historical and archaeological sites, including Gorkha Durbar, Manakamana Temple and Kalika Temple. The National Reconstruction Authority conducted the reconstruction and repair work on these monuments through the Department of Archaeology. “Reconstruction and repair works on 24 heritages, including temple, Pauwa and Sattal, began in the last fiscal year. Many of the sites have been reconstructed while some are nearing completion,” said Adhikari.  "
3,"Four years on, government keeps Lal Commission report secret",https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,"Governments have defied calls, including a court order, to make the report public.","Making public a report by the Lal Commission, formed to investigate the deadly violence in the run-up to the promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal, has remained one of a major demands of the Madhes-based parties.The government in September 2016 formed the high-level commission led by Girish Chandra Lal, a former justice at the Supreme Court, to probe the incidents of atrocities for necessary actions from the government. The commission did field visits, observed the spots and interviewed the victims, witnesses and the stakeholders and on December 16, 2017 submitted its report to the then government, which was also led by Sher Bahadur Deuba in his earlier stint as prime minister. Despite the commitment, the Deuba government never made the report public. CPN-UML Chairperson KP Sharma Oli, who succeeded Deuba on different occasions, said there was no problem in publishing the report. However, despite two rulings from the House of Representatives and the Supreme Court’s order, his government didn’t bring the report to the public domain.Four years have passed on Thursday and the government still keeps the report secret.Following the reluctance of the government, a group of victims demanded the report using the right to information law. However, the government didn’t provide the report, making different excuses. Then the victims reached the National Information Commission asking for its intervention to gain access to the report. As the commission took no initiative, an advocate Sunil Chauhan on behalf of four victims of the violence—Shashidhar Pandeya, Dharmendra Murau, and Gita Kumari Barai of Rupandehi and Awadesh Prasad Kurmi of Parsa—filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court seeking its ruling against the information commission and the government.The court in October 2019 had given a three-month deadline to the information commission and the government to make the report public or give the reasons if it cannot be done so. However, two years have passed, neither the information commission nor the government has abided by the court’s ruling. “The government has ignored the court’s ruling. We can assume that the report has pointed out the state’s atrocity which is why the government is reluctant to release the report,” Chauhan told the Post. “There was no point constituting the commission if the report was not to be made public or implemented.” The lower house on two different occasions directed the then Oli government to present the report in parliament. Then Speaker Krishna Bahadur Mahara issued the ruling first in March 2019 and in August of the same year. However, the Oli administration defied the parliament’s order.Talking to the Post, Lal, the chairperson of the commission, said they have presented the findings based on their study and being fully objective. He claims that there is nothing in the report that cannot be made public. “We studied the atrocities during the protests and presented them with facts,” he told the Post. “We have given the reasons for such protests and recommended solutions.”Protest had erupted in the run-up to the Constitution promulgation, as regional parties opposed the plans of four major forces to push through the finalisation of the statute in the Constituent Assembly. The commission investigated a total of 3,264 complaints it had received.According to the report, 66 people—including 10 police personnel, an 18-month-old toddler, four-year old Samman Patel and 15-year-old Nitu Yadav—were killed during the movement. The commission visited 18 districts for the probe. In Tikapur of Kailali, 10 policemen and an 18-month-old child were brutally killed by agitators in August 2015.“Every government makes a commitment to release the report but it never happens. The culture of not walking the talk has raised questions about the reliability of the government,” said Lal. “The incumbent government in its common minimum programme has committed to make the report public but it hasn’t happened yet.” The common minimum programme of the ruling alliance released on August 8 says the Lal Commission report will be made public.Deuba, who had received the report in 2017, is currently leading the government while the party demanding to make public the report is a ruling coalition partner. “The government will release the report in parliament once the CPN-UML withdraws its protest,” Mahindra Raya Yadav, a leader of the Janata Samajbadi Party who is a minister for Agriculture and Livestock in the Deuba government, told the Post. “We will first study the report and then can say whether it can be implemented.”Chauhan said the victims are for moving the court again if the government continues to delay publicising the report. “We can file a contempt of court case against the government for defying the court,” said Chauhan. “We, on behalf of the victims, will file a petition soon.”  "
