0,"Amid liquidity crunch, government delays raising internal loans",https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,Experts say there is a need to expedite spending so as to give a stimulus to the economy and focus on utilising resources collected from internal debt. ,"It’s almost mid December, but the government has not started raising internal loans yet, citing liquidity crunch in the banking system. Banks and financial institutions in Nepal say they have run out of loanable funds.The Open Market Operation Committee, headed by the central bank deputy governor, in October had recommended that the Finance Ministry schedule debt raising starting mid-November, according to officials at the Public Debt management Office. But the Finance Ministry is yet to take a decision on the matter. “We have not received the schedule for raising internal loans from the Finance Ministry,” said Hira Neupane, under-secretary at the Public Debt Management Office. “I don’t think we will start raising internal loans anytime soon given the liquidity shortage in the market.”Internal debt is an apparatus envisioned in the federal budget as per which the government takes loans from domestic sources—citizens and institutions including banks and financial institutions—by selling debt instruments so as to plug the gap in resources required for spending.Treasury Bills, Development Bonds, Citizens Saving Bonds, National Saving Bonds, and Foreign Employment Saving Bonds are some of the debt instruments that governments have been using to raise internal loans. The banks and financial institutions are big buyers of the government’s debt instruments. Last fiscal year 2020-21, the government had started raising internal loans in early October. The Sher Bahadur Deuba government has downsized the internal loans for the current fiscal year to Rs239 billion through a replacement bill from Rs250 billion proposed by the previous KP Sharma Oli-led government. The proposed size of internal loans stands at 14.62 percent of total budget for the current fiscal year. The total budget size for the current fiscal year is Rs1.63 trillion.Successive governments in Nepal have a poor track record when it comes to spending its resources. Government spending is one of the tools that helps drive the economy.Even though Finance Minister Janardan Sharma promised in September that the government would spend 10 percent of the capital budget every month, it has not been reflected on the ground. According to the Financial Comptroller General Office, as of December 11, the government’s overall spending has been just 22.66 percent of the total budget while capital spending stands at as low as 6.13 percent of the allocated capital budget. The government has earmarked a total of Rs439.65 billion as the capital budget for this fiscal year, according to the office which maintains records of the government’s income and expenditure. The current situation of liquidity crunch in the banking system arose because of excessive lending in early months of the current fiscal year, says Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank.Prakash Kumar Shrestha, chief of economic research department at the central bank, said that excessive lending in the recent months compared to deposit collection led to a cash crunch. According to the central bank, deposits grew by just Rs52 billion till December 9 from the start of the new fiscal year in mid-July, while lending surged by Rs416 billion during the same period.This means the credit to deposit ratio of the banks and financial institutions stands at 95.8 percent, far more than the regulatory limit of 90 percent. As a result, banks and financial institutions are no longer in a position to lend money. The central bank, through its quarterly review of the monetary policy, has told the banks and financial institutions to submit an action plan to reduce the credit to deposit ratio within the limit by the end of the current fiscal year in mid-July 2022.The central bank had targeted average credit growth of 19 percent in the current fiscal year. “But lending grew by as much as 32 percent leading to liquidity crunch,” said Shrestha.With the banking sector facing a liquidity crunch, interest rates have skyrocketed. “Raising funds in the current scenario will be expensive for the government as it will have to pay more interest in internal loans,” said Shrestha. “Since the government spending has remained poor, it has enough money in its treasury. So the government may not have felt the urgency to raise internal loans.”Shrestha deems the delay in raising internal loans at the moment a right decision. He, however, said that the government could raise a certain amount of internal loans to avoid getting overburdened by internal loans in the later months. One factor behind the delay in raising internal loans also could be the change in the budget, as the amount has been reduced.“The main reason for not raising internal loans is because of the liquidity crunch,” said Neupane. “At a time when the private sector is struggling to get loans from the banking sector, the liquidity situation can further worsen if the government starts raising internal loans from the system.”According to the Annual Report on Public Debt 2020-21 released recently by the Public Debt Management Office, Nepal’s domestic debt totals Rs802.94 billion while external debt amounts to Rs934.14 billion. The country’s total outstanding debt liability stands at Rs1737.08 billion.Bidyadhar Mallik, a former finance secretary who has also served as federal affairs minister, said that there is no point in raising internal loans until the government fails to spend available resources. “How would the government spend additional resources when it is struggling to spend the money it already has in the state coffers,” he said.According to him, the government will end up paying higher interests if it needlessly raises internal loans when there is a liquidity crunch in the banking sector. “It will also deprive the private sector of necessary financial resources,” said Mallik.While political instability has been the bane of Nepal’s economy, it was further pulled down by the Covid-19 pandemic. The road to recovery still looks rocky. The government, however, can at least stimulate the economy by channelling resources and expediting spending, experts say.“If the government starts spending its resources, money will flow into the banking sector. Once banks and financial institutions fund the private sectors, it would lead to increased economic activities,” said Mallik.After the 2017 elections, the country was expected to see a steady growth, as a strong government was in place with a mandate to govern for the full five years. However, infighting in the then ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) led to the fall of KP Sharma Oli government in July this year. Nepal was back to coalition government days. Experts and analysts say a coalition government has its own problems, which usually hamstring economic activities also because different parties have different interests.Officials at the Public Debt Management Office say since spending has been poor, the Open Market Operation Committee has recommended raising debts in small amounts for now in view of the liquidity crunch.“The committee has also suggested raising larger amounts of domestic debts in later months of the fiscal year after the liquidity situation eases,” said the official.  "

","Nepal on Sunday received 1,965,600 doses of Moderna vaccine from the COVAX facility.It is the third consignment and part of the 3,712,000 doses of Moderna vaccine committed by the facility, the international vaccine sharing scheme backed by the United Nations.The facility had supplied 188,400 doses of the Moderna vaccine on December 4 and 1,497,600 doses of the vaccine on December 9. “We received 1,965,600 doses of the Moderna vaccine from the COVAX facility today (Sunday),” Badebabu Thapa, a senior officer at the Logistic Management Section under the Department of Health Services, told the Post. The Moderna vaccine is the fifth Covid-19 vaccine Nepal is going to use after AstraZeneca, Vero Cell, Janssen and Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines.The Moderna vaccine needs to be stored in minus 20 degrees Celsius.As the authorities concerned have already stored the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in minus 70 degrees Celsius, the country will not have any problems storing the Moderna vaccine in minus 20 degrees Celsius, officials said.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine will be administered to children between 12 and 17 years in 57 districts from December 20.According to the Ministry of Health and Population, the vaccine will not be administered in 20 districts, where the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine was administered earlier.“Preparations are underway to roll out the Moderna vaccine from December 20 in 57 districts,” Sagar Dahal, chief of the National Immunisation Programme, told the Post. “Students will be jabbed at their respective schools”After poor response from the priority groups—immunity compromised people–health authorities had opened the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children between 12 and 17 years on November 22. Officials said that the local units have already been urged to make a list of children eligible for the jabs.Dahal said that the estimated population of children between 12 and 17 years is around 3.5 million but the target group for the existing Moderna vaccines is only 1.8 million children.“We will have sufficient doses for the 1.8 million children,” said Dahal.The Health Ministry said that the COVAX facility will supply 620,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, which will be administered in districts where the said vaccine has been administered to children between 12 to 17 years of age.Nepal launched its Covid-19 vaccination campaign on January 27 this year with 1 million doses of Covishield gifted by India.Nepal needs to vaccinate around 78 percent of its over 30 million estimated population, or around 25 million people, as per the government’s new plan that includes those aged between 12 and 18 years. Earlier, the government had planned to vaccinate only those aged 15 years and above. As of Saturday, 9,241,261 people (30.4 percent of the total population) have been fully immunised. Nepal so far has received 27,147,440 doses of Covid-19 vaccines—Vero Cell, AstraZeneca, Janssen, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.Nepal also purchased 4 million doses of the Moderna vaccine through COVAX’s cost-sharing scheme using the Asian Development Bank’s loan. The doses are expected to be delivered within the first quarter of 2022.Nepal so far has received 29,113,040 doses of Covid-19 vaccines—Vero Cell, AstraZeneca, Janssen, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. "
2,Beding linked with national electricity grid,https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,Rs30 million was spent to supply power to the village by installing 390 electricity poles. ,"Beding village in the remote northern part of Dolakha district has been linked with the national transmission line.The Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) constructed a 24-km-long transmission line of 11KV from Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project’s powerhouse to supply electricity to the village. According to the NEA, a budget of Rs 30 million was spent to supply electricity to the village by installing 390 utility poles.“Our village was left behind when it came to development because we did not have electricity supply,” said Nawang Tenji Lama, a local resident. “Now that we are connected to the national transmission line, we hope we will get an uninterrupted supply of electricity.”The villagers have been relying on solar and oil lamps as the local micro hydropower has remained closed for the past 10 years. Although the village had a telecom network via Nepal Telecom, it wasn’t of much use without electricity, say locals. The locals, however, remain sceptical. They question the durability of the utility poles installed for electricity transmission. “We receive heavy rainfall every year. I’m not sure if the poles are erected properly,” said Lama. “I’m afraid we will be back in darkness if the weather turns bad.” Lama says the contractor did not do a thorough job of erecting the utility poles in the village. “They have placed some utility poles in the middle of the foot trail along the Rolwaling stream. We had submitted a memorandum to the NEA asking them not to install the electricity poles on the foot trail but our request was not addressed,” said Lama.Beding village, which lies at ward 9 of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality, is around 80 km north from Charikot, the district headquarters of Dolakha. The village is not even connected with the national road network. There are 85 households of Sherpa and Tamang communities in the village that lies at an altitude of 3,721 metres above sea level.“We never thought our village would be linked to the national grid. It is a huge achievement for the development of this remote village. But we are worried whether the electricity line can sustain harsh weather conditions,” said Tsering Sherpa, the ward chairman of Gaurishankar-9.The expansion of the electricity line to the village has been completed and the NEA is now installing transformers. “Insulator wires have been used to connect the village to the national grid. We will soon transport two transformers to the village. Electricity supply will reach the village in about two weeks now,” said Meghnath Dhakal, chief at the Dolakha distribution centre of the NEA. According to Dhakal, it was a challenge to connect the village to the national grid since most of the equipment, wires and utility poles had to be transported to the village by porters. Addressing the locals’ concerns about the durability of the utility poles and the contractor’s work, Dhakal said technicians from NEA will soon make a field visit to the village to monitor the quality of work being done.“The electricity line has reached the village. We will ask the contractor to remove utility poles from the middle of the foot trail so that they won’t inconvenience locals and tourists alike,” he said. Beding lies along the Tsho-Rolpa trekking route in Rolwaling valley and is a tourist destination.  "
3,Congress is broken. It needs fixing,https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,An overhauled ideology—and an organisational rejig—is a must to inject new blood into the grand old party. ,"On Sunday, Nepali Congress leader Sher Bahadur Deuba urged the general convention delegates to vote for him in the party president election.“If I lose, everyone will create a ruckus… they will say how can someone who lost the party president post will govern the country,” said Deuba, who is also the prime minister leading a five-party coalition. “If I win the party presidency, this coalition will continue… until the next elections.”Deuba, who leads the establishment faction in the party, is not only eying a repeat as party president but also yet another stint—sixth—as prime minister after the elections next year.Four days ago, on Thursday, Gagan Thapa, a Congress youth leader, organised an event at Nepal Academy. In a jam-packed hall, Thapa, 46, made public his political document—a roadmap for the party, for the country. He has outlined some immediate measures for the next one year until the elections and long-term steps that the party should take for the next five years.Thapa is contesting for party general secretary from the anti-establishment faction.In his document, Thapa has said the party has almost given up the tradition of ideological discussions and debates.“Even while taking important decisions in the party, wider discussions are rarely held,” reads the document. “Nor are there any debates on the decisions.”Thapa appears to be clear why debates and discussions on a wide range of issues—political, social, economic, organisational—are a must in a party.Party insiders and observers say how Deuba and Thapa, who represent two different generations, view the ongoing convention—what they want to achieve—shows the stark reality of today's Congress. According to them, time has come for the party to transform.But for that the party needs an idea. It needs principles and programmes. It has to set goals.How the Nepali Congress, founded in 1947 with lucid principles and goals, became a party without an idea then?One of the most revered leaders of the party, the late BP Koirala, had laid down the principles and programmes for the Nepali Congress. Democratic socialism was the goal.The Congress still harps on nationalism, democracy and socialism, but ever since the restoration of democracy in 1990, it appears to have done precious little to make its members—and the public— aware of the essence of its idea and the core values of the party.After the restoration of democracy in 1990, Nepali Congress came to power. But none of the leaders carried forward the party’s principles. Leaders engaged in power politics. Factionalism ruled the roost. After getting frustrated at groupism and power politics, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, known as an austere leader, who held the party’s values and principles close to his heart, decided to detach himself from the Congress. He led the party from January 1988 to January 1992. The last two years of his leadership saw the country transition into democracy from Panchayat. The late Ganesh Man Singh who gave his whole life to the party never held any office of profit. Nor did he run for party president. His son Prakash Man Singh is currently pitted against Deuba, Shekhar Koirala and Bimalendra Nidhi. Like Singh, both Koirala and Nidhi have their own family legacies—the former is the nephew of the late BP Koirala and the latter is the son of Congress stalwart Mahendra Narayan Nidhi. Subsequent leaders helmed the Congress—Girija Prasad Koirala (three times from 1992 to 2010) and Sushil Koirala (from 2010 to2016)—barely gave priority to party ideologies. Many may ascribe that lacking to political upheavals—a decade of Maoist insurgency from 1996 to 2006 and constitution drafting from 2008 to 2015.Deuba, who won the party president post in March 2016 general convention, is known as a leader who dared to challenge the Koiralas. He holds a solid political background—coming from student politics, Deuba rose through the ranks over the years to lead the party. Holding the prime minister’s office for a fifth time may easily find its place in history books as an achievement. But Deuba has never been known as a leader who prioritises party principles and ideologies.Over the years, those at the party helm continued to propagate the idea: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”Analysts say the grand old party by and large for decades has fed on “BP’s dreams,” whatever that meant for the party members or the public. As the Congress is holding its 14th general convention, it is standing at a crossroads. A revised ideological line and an organisational overhaul is a must in the party, say analysts and insiders.Except for Thapa, none of the leaders contesting for various posts, however, have floated any concrete plans as to how they want to steer the party and the country. Not even Shekhar Koirala, the party president aspirant, from whose panel Thapa is contesting for general secretary.“In Nepal’s politics, Nepali Congress is just not a party organisation, it is an idea. It is a campaign,” Thapa says in his 60-page document. “By virtue of being one of the oldest parties and a force that led various changes in the country, the direction taken by the Nepali Congress defines the path for the country.”The party, adds Thapa, hence, through this convention, must draw up an ideological framework and political roadmap for 2021-2025.Observers say it’s unfortunate that senior Nepali Congress leaders have neither time nor energy to read and discuss Thapa’s proposal. The Congress has said the party will hold its “policy convention” to discuss its ideology, principles and goals. No date has been fixed yet.Indra Bahadur Gurung, 83, from Syangja has been a long-time Congress member, who has formerly been in the party Central Working Committee. “The party’s broken and it must be fixed,” said Gurung, who is in Kathmandu to vote to elect a new leadership. He is one of the 4,743 delegates that will elect 13 office bearers and 134 Central Working Committee members. “But I am not convinced whoever comes to the leadership will be able to transform the party.”Gurung believes there is a serious dearth of leaders who actually care for the party. “I am not happy with the youth leaders also because of the way they are switching sides just to win the election,” he said. But many say there is a whiff of change this time, as quite some youth leaders have entered the fray challenging the old faces.Gagan Thapa, Bishwa Prakash Sharma and Pradip Poudel, among others, who came from student politics, especially after the 1990’s political change, have inspired hopes.The party, however, can elect only two general secretaries.“Not everything is lost as yet. There is hope,” said Shankar Tiwari, 37, a candidate for the Central Working Committee. “Since the 12th convention the younger generation has started challenging the older generation.”Tiwari agrees that the party is in dire need of transformation. His recently published book is titled “Who will fix the Congress?”, in an indication that the party is indeed broken.“Whoever wins the two general secretary posts, the party will get young blood,” said Tiwari.In the Congress, the general secretary post is considered the most powerful after the party president, even though it has two vice president posts.Shree Krishna Aniruddha Gautam, a political commentator who has followed Congress and national politics for years, says the grand old party does need transformation, but the party leaders first need to diagnose the problem.“Everyone seems to have forgotten the foundation… the basis on which the party was constituted,” Gautam told the Post. “A renewed and vigorous debate is required to give the party a new direction in the changed context. What are the goals of the party? How does it want to achieve these goals? What are its principles?”To diagnose the problem, according to Gautam, the party needs to assess itself first.Complacency could be yet another reason why the Nepali Congress has not discussed its plans, programmes and policies. Since 1990, the party has managed to remain in power for most of the years.The 2017 election results, however, were shocking. The party faced a spectacular defeat. Fighting against the communist behemoth—the CPN-UML and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) had formed an alliance—Congress could secure just 23 seats out of the 165 positions up for grabs under the direct election system, under Deuba’s leadership.The party, however, never tried to hold any extensive discussions to find out why it lost. Deuba refused to stand down as party president. “It’s a shame that the Congress is still not paying attention to some fundamentals,” said Daman Nath Dhungana, a civil society leader who actively participated in both people’s movements in 1990 and 2006. “Transformation of the Congress party will be incomplete until it finds ways to address the challenges faced by the country and meet the expectations of the people,” added Dhungana who had contested the 2017 parliamentary elections on a Congress ticket but lost.Over the years, the Congress party has lost touch with the people, even its own members, say some old party hands.Sanat Kumar Mandal, 52, is in Kathmandu to participate in the party’s general convention.“I have been with the party for the last 34 years and served in different committees,” said Mandal from Siraha. “But my party does not behave like a democratic party anymore. The mighty and powerful bulldoze decisions. Nepotism is rife. I don’t think the people these days, despite being supporters of the party, can connect to the Congress.”According to Mandal, it’s high time the party bade farewell to old faces and gave a chance to youths to steer the party.“It would be better for the party to revise its statute and put an age-limit so that new blood and fresh ideas could be brought in,” said Mandal. “The party leadership should stop pitching abstract ideas and get down to real business. Transformation starts from the grassroots. First and foremost, the party needs to re-establish its connection with the people. If there are no people, there is no party.” "
