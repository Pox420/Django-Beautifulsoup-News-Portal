0,Nepal’s vaccination rate has slowed down despite enough doses in stock,https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,"Authorities must figure out reasons and expedite immunisation pace so that as many people can be covered at the earliest, public health experts say. ","Surya Lama, who hails from Barhabishe of Sindhupalchok district, works as a mason at a construction site in Kathmandu. His wife Karuna, who underwent a uterus surgery a few months ago due to infection, is recovering.Both have not received Covid-19 vaccines yet.“I have to work from morning to evening to eke out a living,” said Lama, 36. “My wife could not reach the vaccination centre on her own, and I did not get the time to take her for vaccination.”He is not sure how big a risk there will be if he is exposed to the virus, he said. “I have heard of this Corona and also about vaccines,” he said, though. The Lamas appear to be few of those missing out on Covid-19 vaccines in urban centres. But there are concerns of many more people in rural areas not having received Covid-19 vaccines yet for multiple reasons, including a lack of awareness, inaccessibility or due to hesitancy. When Nepal managed to vaccinate 15 percent of its total population in September, the World Health Organisation’s South-East Asia office lauded the country for good management of the vaccination drive and its ability to vaccinate thousands of people in a short span of time.Though there were initial hiccups caused by shortages of doses, the vaccination campaign continued to pick up pace, as there was a steady flow of jabs. But lately, the drive seems to have slowed down. Data provided by the Ministry of Health and Population show that 9,582,496 people (31.5 percent of the total population) have been fully immunised as of Saturday.A comparison shows it took more than 100 days for the authorities to immunise an additional 15 percent of the total population, and around 55 days to administer vaccines to an additional 9 percent population (from 21.4 percent on October 17 to 30.4 percent on December 11).Vaccine scarcity was not an issue, as Nepal was receiving doses in millions on a regular basis. Experts say authorities have been using the same strategy—asking people to come to vaccination centres set up at the health facilities of districts in the initial stage of the drive. Authorities are not taking any extra initiatives to bring people to vaccination centres or make them aware of the need to get vaccinated, they say.With storage facilities filled to the brim, authorities have requested the vaccine providers, including the COVAX facility, to delay shipments.Public health experts say it’s unfortunate that the authorities have failed to scale up the vaccination drive and instead are asking for a slowdown in shipments.Nepal so far has received 31,195,090 doses of Covid-19 vaccines—Vero Cell, AstraZeneca, Janssen, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, including an additional 1,457,650 doses delivered on Thursday from Germany.This suggests there are ample doses in stock to vaccinate a little over 6 million people almost immediately.Nepal needs to vaccinate around 78 percent of its over 30 million estimated population, or around 25 million people. Since 4-5 million Nepalis are said to be living abroad, the number of people who need to be vaccinated is estimated to be around 20 million. Experts say there is a need to ramp up vaccination and consider providing booster doses.“Instead of asking for delay in vaccine shipments, authorities should have used this window to vaccinate most of the people at the earliest,” Dr Biraj Karmacharya, an epidemiologist, told the Post. “Vaccinating the maximum number of people could save thousands of lives.”The Ministry of Health and Population said that “it has been doing its best” to vaccinate as many people as possible. Officials claimed that they have held meetings with provincial and local level officials and urged them to speed up the vaccination drive.Minister for Health and Population Birodh Khatiwada on Thursday had told the Post that vaccines will be administered from over 16,000 centres that have been used for immunising children as part of the monthly campaign. Along with this, the government is also providing vaccination facilities from schools, targeting those aged between 12 and 17 years.“We are also holding meetings with the chief district officers of all 77 districts throughout the country,” said Dr Roshan Pokhrel, secretary at the Ministry of Health and Population. “We will again request them to do everything to increase the coverage so that a maximum number of people could be vaccinated.”Doctors say the authorities must come up with new strategies to cover a maximum number of people. There could be multiple reasons for the vaccination pace slowing down, and authorities need to find out and act accordingly, they say. “Those who are aware of the importance of vaccines took the jabs when they got a chance,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Authorities did not have to work hard to immunise those people. But there could be hundreds of thousands of people who may have missed out on the jabs for various reasons. Some might not be aware… others might not know the importance of getting vaccinated.”Along with inconveniences of time and place of vaccination, there could be some people who might be hesitant about taking the vaccine. The emergence of sceptics when there is a new vaccine or drug is a worldwide phenomenon. Authorities should use every means to debunk rumours, if they are being spread, by disseminating a clear and fact-based message about vaccines to the communities, doctors say.“Authorities should use every possible means, and possible persons—teachers, female community health volunteers, health workers, social workers, national level artists, politicians and political parties—to raise awareness about the vaccine and encourage people to get jabbed,” said Karmacharya, who is also the head of the Department of Community Programme. Scaling up the vaccination drive and launching booster doses are the common suggestions public health experts have been offering lately, especially in the wake of Omicron, the new iteration of the coronavirus which is said to be highly contagious. Its severity, however, is said to be milder, compared to Delta.The World Health Organisation said on Saturday the Omicron variant has been reported in 89 countries and the number of cases is doubling in 1.5 to 3 days in areas with community transmission.Nepal reported two Omicron cases last month, but both tested negative for the virus later.Dr GD Thakur, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, said authorities can learn from India, Nepal’s southern neighbour, as well on ways to pace up the vaccination drive.India’s vaccination pace was also disappointing until October. Festivities across the country were considered among the reasons for a decline in the vaccination pace.But by December-end, it is estimated that 42 percent of India’s total population will be fully inoculated. India had administered more than 1 billion doses of vaccine and given full doses to 31 percent of the population in October.“There is a need for authorities to take a proactive approach so that as many people as possible can be vaccinated at the earliest,” Thakur told the Post. “Administering vaccines to the maximum number of people is the only way to save lives.” "
1,"In the UML, discontent is growing as party forms committees",https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,"Some who challenged Oli are failing to find positions, others want a system to govern the organisation. ","On Friday, CPN-UML Secretary General Shanker Pokhrel announced that senior leader Bhim Rawal was appointed a member in the party’s advisory committee.Rawal, who lost to KP Sharma Oli in the party chair race in the 10th national congress of the party, was expected to be nominated either in the Standing Committee or the Central Committee.He, however, had earlier refused to become a Central Committee member. “Since Rawal is not a Central Committee member, he has not been given any responsibility in the party. A meeting of the Central Committee has decided to appoint him a member of the party advisory committee,” said Pokhrel.“Whether he should be given more responsibility in the party will be decided by the party chair.”Until another arrangement is made, Rawal will advise the party as a member of the advisory committee, according to Pokhrel.Amrit Kumar Bohora chairs the party’s advisory council.Rawal on Saturday refused to accept the position. “I have heard that I have been appointed a member of the UML advisory committee. If this is true, handpicking me without even asking me, it is objectionable,” Rawal wrote on Twitter on Saturday. “Such a trend is against the spirit of People’s Multiparty Democracy and democratic values.”Rawal is seen as an opposition in the party for standing up to party chair Oli, who bulldozed his decisions during the party’s recently concluded national congress. Despite Oli’s call for selecting the party leadership on the basis of consensus, Rawal refused to budge and filed his candidacy against the party chair. Rawal is one of the 10 leaders who once had sided with Madhav Kumar Nepal to challenge Oli. But when Nepal decided to form a new party, Rawal stayed back in the UML.Insiders say Oli is not likely to accept anyone who has challenged him in the party.“The party should run on the basis of consensus but Oli wants to run the party his way… that is the problem,” said Tanka Karki, another dissident leader in the UML, who was defeated in the party secretary election.During a recent Central Committee meeting, some leaders, including Ghanashyam Bhusal, had expressed dissatisfaction at Oli’s working style and some ideological and organisational issues.Bhusal is also among the 10 leaders to have challenged Oli in the party. The UML had gone into the convention with a promise to end factionalism and unite the party. Oli wanted everyone to be one herd following him, as his party had faced a split after the Madhav Nepal faction formed the CPN (Unified Sociliast).“I do not see any reset in the party for another four-five years. We have made the organisational structures exceptionally big. It has not become a party that can confront national and international challenges,” said Karki. “We are at a nascent phase when it comes to the party building process. On ideological and organisational fronts also, we need to do a lot of work.”Despite some opposition, Oli managed to prove that he ruled the roost in the party, all office bearers were elected as per his wish. Some of those dissidents who had challenged Oli were, however, “adjusted” after they came into Oli’s fold.In the lead up to the party’s national congress, Subas Nembang had sought the senior vice chair post but he later settled for the party vice chair.In the new order of precedence set by the party, Nembang now ranks seventh after Ram Bahadur Thapa, a former Maoist leader who joined the UML only a few months ago. Insiders said Nembang is not happy with the new set-up, especially for being ranked seventh. Nembang, however, told the Post he did not believe in such protocols and orders.“I do not give much priority to such issues,” said Nembang in a brief interview. “I am already the deputy leader of the Parliamentary Party. Ours is a democratic party.”Insiders say Oli’s core team is well aware of the fact that dissatisfaction is growing within the party. According to them, many have voiced their reservations about the way Oli picked Central Committee, Politburo and Standing Committee members.The UML formed a 99-member Politburo and 45-member Standing Committee last week.A leader who represents the dissident group said that initial signs are not good and the way Oli is building the party may have consequences, including for the next elections. Some leaders like Naresh Kharel, Dipak Prakash Bhatt, Surendra Manadhar, Yogendra Shahi and Bhaskar Kafle, among others, have failed to make it to the Central Committee. Analysts say the UML badly lacks a system and the party has become a group run by Oli. Khagendra Prasai, assistant professor at Kathmandu University, said that Oli is not running the party as a chair but he is acting more like the head of a clique.“I do not even consider the 10th national congress as a convention of a communist party. The convention just reestablished Oli. That is why Oli is systematically sidelining his dissidents in the party,” said Prasai.Discontent in Oli’s party began after he started working unilaterally, ignoring the party system when he was the chair of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) which was formed after a merger between the UML and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre).Over two thirds of the Standing Committee members last year had sought his resignation as prime minister and put Oli in a fix. After finding himself cornered, Oli on December 20 dissolved the House of Representatives. Later in March this year, the Supreme Court invalidated the NCP and revived the UML and the Maoist Centre.But Oli faced opposition from yet another group in the UML—by the Madhav Nepal faction. After Nepal decided to part ways and form his own party, Oli emerged as the numero uno leader in the UML. Oli supporters, however, say things are fine in the UML. “We held such a successful convention to democratically elect a new leadership. If some people are not happy, it does not matter,” said Bishnu Rijal, deputy chief of the party’s Publicity Department. “There are no discords and differences in the party, as reported outside. In the case of Rawal, he was not ready for nomination in either the Standing Committee or the Central Committee. As far as Nembang is concerned, he was not an office bearer in the party earlier. It’s wrong to say that the party is not following the system and leaders are unhappy.” "
2,Rukum (West) residents demand blood transfusion centres,https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,The district does not have a blood transfusion centre which means patients and their families have to run from pillar to post looking for donors in their hour of need. ,"Nandaram Khadka, a resident of Tribeni Rural Municipality in Rukum (West), got his father admitted to the district hospital for surgery last week. The hours following his father’s admission were hectic, as Khadka had to look for a blood donor for his father’s treatment. He finally found a Nepal Army personnel to donate blood after 24 hours of search, he says.Rukum (West) does not have a blood transfusion centre, which means patients and their families have to run from pillar to post looking for blood donors in their hour of need.Subas Mahat of Sisne Rural Municipality had taken his wife to the district hospital last month for delivery. Doctors at the hospital asked him to manage blood for his wife’s surgery but he could not find a donor. It took him seven hours to find a Nepal Army personnel to donate blood for his wife’s treatment.The residents of the district have time and again stressed the need for a blood transfusion centre in Rukum (West) to avoid last-minute searches for blood donors.“We take patients to the hospital in emergency cases and for planned surgeries. In addition to the pressure of a medical procedure, we have to take on the added worry about managing blood for our patient,” said Kamal Khadka of Tribeni. “It’s hard to come by willing donors and we rarely find donors of the same blood type as asked by the hospital. It’s usually Nepal Army soldiers who step up to donate blood. It’s time we have a blood transfusion centre in the district.” Security personnel of Nepal Army and Nepal Police and health workers at the hospital are the only willing donors, says Kamal. The Nepal Red Cross Society had attempted to establish a blood bank in Rukum (West) five years ago and had used a room of the district hospital for the purpose. But the organisation could not meet the necessary requirements and the plan was left in limbo. Critical patients brought to the district hospital for emergency procedures are hardest hit by the lack of a blood transfusion centre in the district. The doctors refer such patients to medical facilities outside the district to avoid health catastrophes. “We refer critical patients to health institutions outside the district because we don’t have a blood transfusion centre here. We ask the patient’s family to arrange for blood before surgery but in some cases, that is not possible,” said Dr Kehal Bikram GC, the obstetrician and gynaecologist at the hospital.“Sometimes the doctors and health workers involved in the treatment and surgery of a patient donate blood in the operation theatre itself,” said GC. Bishnu Bahadur Shahi’s daughter went into labour and was in need of immediate cesarean surgery two months ago. A resident of Musikot Municipality, Shahi had a hard time finding a suitable blood donor for his daughter. “The lack of blood banks in the district is a major problem. The concerned authorities have not paid any attention to it. This is a matter of life and death of patients and should be taken seriously,” said Shahi. "
3,Food adulteration offences rise even during lockdown,https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,"As long as consumers consider food adulteration a minor problem and the government plays down its impact, such offences will keep growing, rights activists say. ","Food adulteration is widespread in Nepal with a long list of food items ranging from milk, dairy products, spices and water to tea, edible oil and lentils found to be contaminated with unhealthy ingredients, officials said.Unscrupulous traders seemed to have been busy even during the lockdown debasing food products and selling them to unsuspecting Nepalis. When the coronavirus pandemic hit the country last year, the government ordered everyone to be confined indoors for months on end to prevent the spread of the virus. Another lockdown was imposed on April 29 that lasted until September 1 as the infection caseload surged.But that did not stop dishonest manufacturers from trying to make a quick buck by adding prohibited substances in food products that are consumed by the people, creating a direct threat to public health.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control said it had initiated action against 27 companies at different district administration offices and courts in the first three months of the fiscal year (July 15 to October 15). The manufacturers have been charged with mixing illegal ingredients in food products and selling items unfit for human consumption.Consumer rights activists said the production and distribution of adulterated and expired foods kept rising even during the lockdown period. ""This happened because the government was not present in the market,"" they said. Conducting a series of market inspections, the department and its regional offices collected 852 samples of food products from across the country during the review period. Among them, 36 samples were found to be adulterated or not fit for consumption.Consumer rights activists say that as long as consumers consider food adulteration a minor problem and the government plays down its impact on the health system, such offences will keep growing.""There are three tiers of government in Nepal, and all of them have been mandated to conduct market inspections. Despite all that legal clout, food adulteration has kept on spreading,"" said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum.“We don’t feel any presence of the government in the market. The market is functioning or is controlled by powerful traders.” Maharjan said the existing Food Act 1967 was very weak. “As the District Administrative Office is one of the agencies responsible for judging market malpractice cases, nobody bothers to file a case even if they are cheated. There is so much bureaucracy that nobody even knows what verdict has been passed.” Among the companies taken to court by the department, Nepal Tea Development Corporation of Charpane, Jhapa faced action for using labeling on its tea packages that were not as per the standard.Kalika Dairy, Bhaktapur was charged with producing or selling adulterated curd. Tanahu-based bread factory Krishna Pauroti Udyog violated labelling rules and Om Kailash Dhara Oil Mill of Bara was caught for selling low quality mustard oil.Action was taken against Aqua Nepal Bisleri, a Rupandehi-based drinking water factory, for producing or selling adulterated water. Aashirbad Agro and Foods, Nawalparasi was found producing or selling low quality spices, Rajdhani Dairy housed in the Patan Industrial Area was found producing and selling adulterated processed milk, and Nepal Pellet Feed Industry of Bidur was charged with producing and selling adulterated chicken feed. Buttabari Tea in Jhapa was found producing and selling low quality tea.“Hearings in most of the cases are in progress at different district administrative offices and courts,” said Matina Joshi Vaidya, director general at the department.“We do not know much about the action taken on the cases we have filed,” she said. “The department does not even have a record of the verdicts passed by the district administration offices or courts.”The government report said that nine cases were filed against milk and dairy related product makers, five against producers of spices, five producers of lentil and food items made from it, and three processed drinking water producers.Two cases have been filed against tea producers, and one case each has been filed against sauce, edible oil and animal feed companies.Officials at the department said consumer cases never get priority as the district administrative offices and courts are busy in other cases most of the time.“So it takes a lot of time to get verdicts on consumer related cases,” said Maharjan.Three years have passed since the amended Consumer Protection Act 2018, which contains a provision requiring the government to establish a consumer court, was endorsed. But there are no indications of a consumer court being set up.“This shows how serious the government is about ensuring the rights of consumers,” activists said.The government has requested the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs to form a consumer court, and a draft of the work procedure has been prepared.Vaidya said a consumer court would be formed according to the Consumer Act while the Food Act is itself a specialised act, and the actions taken against various firms were taken as per this law.She added that the Food Act does not specifically mention expired food products, due to which the action taken against offenders seems lenient.Last July, the government registered a bill to amend and integrate laws related to food purity and quality in Parliament. The proposed legislation envisages stern penalties against producers and sellers of substandard and adulterated food.It has been three years since the draft of the bill was prepared, but it has got nowhere due to the endless political turmoil. The penalties proposed in the new law are significantly harsher than those prescribed by the prevailing Food Act which sets a maximum penalty of six months in jail and Rs5,000 in fines.Vaidya said the bill was being discussed at the Legislative Committee of the Upper House.“The government has not paid much attention to educating consumers about their rights. It doesn't have a budget to do that either.” "
4,Plan to table MCC in Parliament set to charge up politics,https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,Deuba for moving the bill for its passage amid reservations from his coalition partners who want amendments to some clauses in the US grant agreement. ,"The Millennium Challenge Corporation appears set to charge up Nepali politics, once again, as the government prepares to table it in Parliament for its passage, just as coalition partners continue to maintain their reservations.Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who recently reclaimed the Nepali Congress president post, has expedited consultations with cross-party leaders to what insiders say “create a conducive environment for tabling” the MCC, under which Nepal is supposed to receive $500 million in a grant from the US government.Deuba on Friday held a meeting with Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chair of Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), a key coalition partner in the current government. Dahal has been saying the MCC compact cannot be endorsed in its present form.During Friday's meeting, Dahal suggested that Deuba call an all-party meeting before tabling the MCC in the House for its endorsement, according to leaders. “The party chair [Dahal] suggested that the prime minister call an all-party meeting to discuss the MCC before Tuesday's House meeting,” Ramesh Malla, chief personal secretary to Dahal, told the Post. “The prime minister has promised a meeting of parties.”On Saturday, Deuba called an all-party meeting for 4pm Sunday.“A host of issues, including House obstruction, the MCC and pending bills, is on the agenda,” Bal Krishna Khand, the minister for home affairs, told the Post.The main opposition, CPN-UML, quickly responded, saying it will not attend the meeting.“There’s no point in going to a meeting which has been called just for formality,” said a senior UML leader.As far as Deuba is concerned, his position on the US grant is clear. He wants its swift ratification from Parliament. The Maoist Centre, as well as the CPN (Unified Socialist), the Janata Samajbadi Party and Rastriya Janamorcha—all of them Deuba’s coalition partners—however, have some reservations.“Deuba wants to present the MCC for ratification at any cost. He is pressuring the ruling alliance for it,” said a leader of the Maoist Centre, on condition of anonymity. “Chairperson [Dahal], therefore, suggested for the all-party meeting.”The Janamorcha has threatened to part ways with the alliance if the government tables the compact for ratification in the present form.The CPN (Unified Socialist) has said it will oppose any move to table the MCC without amendments to some clauses. “There will be a political clash if the prime minister pushes the MCC without a revision,” Jagannath Khatiwada, the party’s spokesperson, told the Post. “He will be solely responsible for it. The present document undermines national sovereignty.” Some political parties and sections of the intelligentia argue that a clause in the MCC Nepal Compact supersedes Nepali law. The MCC headquarters and the American embassy in Kathmandu, however, have clarified that the MCC is not above Nepal’s constitution.At the time of the MCC’s signing in September 2017, Deuba was leading a coalition government, backed by the Maoist Centre.After the 2017 elections, a communist government was formed under KP Sharma Oli, who was backed by Maoist Centre’s Dahal. The erstwhile Oli government had owned up the agreement and registered it in Parliament in July 2019.Oli and Dahal’s parties had merged to form the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), in which the American grant had emerged as a major divisive force. The NCP, however, was invalidated in March this year. Oli on more than one occasion has blamed then-Speaker Krishna Bahadur Mahara for not taking the MCC forward in Parliament, apparently at the behest of Dahal, the Maoist chair. Mahara, a long-time Maoist leader and Dahal’s close ally, stepped down on October 1, 2019 following attempt to rape allegations.The current Speaker, Agni Sapkota, is also a Maoist leader.The Speaker’s role is crucial when it comes to listing the House agenda. A senior official at the Parliament Secretariat said that on issues of serious concerns, the Speaker holds talks with cross-party leaders before including them in the day’s agenda. “Minor bills are included if the government wants. However, that doesn’t apply to those that have long-term consequences,” said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the matter. “Deciding the agenda for the House is his prerogative. The Speaker will definitely talk to cross-party leaders on the MCC.”Whether Sapkota will agree to move the MCC for its endorsement depends largely also on what his political master—Dahal—says, according to individuals following the developments closely.Dahal, many say, appears to have made a rod for his own back by vehemently opposing the MCC. Dahal wants to maintain his partnership with Deuba, at least until elections, but his support for the MCC could ignite a mutiny in his own party, as some leaders like Dev Gurung and Lilamani Pokhrel are objecting to the American grant’s endorsement.According to one Parliament official, if an all-party meeting builds a consensus among the parties, the scenario could be different.Though the UML wanted to ratify the compact when it was in government, its tone has changed after it was shunted to the opposition benches.The party has been resorting to House obstructions. It has taken exception to Speaker Sapkota’s non-action on its decision to expel 14 of the party lawmakers, including Madhav Nepal, who went on to form their own party—CPN (Unified Sociliast).Sources say Deuba has reached out to UML chair Oli also to seek support in endorsing the MCC.“We won’t lift House obstructions for the MCC. The government, if it wishes, can endorse it like the bills related to the budget,” Khagaraj Adhikari, the party’s Standing Committee member, told the Post.“The ruling alliance doesn’t need our help to endorse it as it already has the support of 165 lawmakers,” he added, referring to the number of votes Prime Minister Deuba had received on July 18 when sought the vote of confidence.The compact can be endorsed by a simple majority in the 271-strong House. Four bills related to the national budget were endorsed in September, amid the UML’s obstruction, using marshals.In a press meet on Friday, Shanker Pokhrel, the UML general secretary, said they will make their opinion public on the MCC once the government tables it in the House. “Our focus is on Parliament now. The Speaker must give a way out to the present deadlock which was created because of him,” he said. “Either the Speaker has to take action against the lawmakers as per the UML’s recommendation or he should resign. Our obstruction will continue until our demand is met.”Talks about the government preparing to table the MCC in the House also follow a meeting of the MCC Board of Directors in the United States on December 14 where the Nepal Compact was on the agenda.“MCC Board of Directors received an update and discussed the progress to date of the $500 million Nepal Compact,” the MCC headquarters said in a statement on Saturday. “The Board of Directors made note of the commitment by the government of Nepal to seek to ratify the compact in the near term.” "

6,Of politics and teachers,https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,The history of overt and covert allegiances of teachers to political groups spans many decades.,"Recently, a debate about the participation of teachers in active politics has emerged in earnest in Nepal. This subject has been triggered by the intervention of prominent leaders of different political parties. They were alarmed by the Election Commission's warning on November 23 and the High Court ruling that teachers cannot take an active role in politics, not least in the propaganda work of the parties to which they owe their allegiance. This is not as simple as it may sound, and this is not a new debate, either. This has come as a hot topic now because the parties that have entered a new phase of political rivalry after a series of splits, legal battles, national conferences and reorganisations realise that they are in dire need of educated people to create the party mechanism. For that, the role of teachers with their clout among students and their guardians is deemed to be necessary. Though the teachers have not come out in hordes to join the political parties, the number of involved parties is significant. The history of overt and covert allegiances of teachers to political groups spans many decades. We should look back at the history of the political parties that are currently in dominant positions. The political parties did not find it easy to perform activities during the Panchayat times that lasted until 1990. They could not create contacts with the people and draw mass support for their activities. So, they always relied on teachers for the purpose of spreading their ideologies or their ""isms"" as it is commonly known in Nepal. The political parties espoused either communist or democratic values as the basis of their political activities. They needed both educated and free people to create forums for that purpose. But it was not easy to create such forums openly because of the Panchayat dictatorship in the country. So the parties tacitly created zones of influence outside the controlled spheres of the Panchayat system by using educational institutions. The people who carried out their missions were teachers. Panchayat autocracyGradually, that turned into hegemony in terms of creating a tacit consensus among teachers who worked in tandem with those who opposed the Panchayat autocracy. This hegemony was a mode of resistance. The agencies that created this unique hegemony used the sphere of education, schools and colleges, and some popular support for that. The accoutrements that this hegemony used were cultural activities, progressive songs, poetry and some political rhetoric. Those who performed these activities were teachers, and for them, that was a double bind—they openly performed educational work and covertly performed political activities. The banned political parties found this double bind of school and college teachers useful to spread their influences. The parties, too, became quite successful in using the teachers' aspirations for democracy.The hegemony used ideologies to create a space for activism in the sphere of education involving teachers and tertiary level students who espoused democratic political values. But the teachers also drew salaries paid from the state funds. That was a unique aspect of this double bind. The teachers did perform their pedagogic activities regularly, and that was their strength. At the same time, many teachers of that period became leaders of different political parties. If we ask active political leaders today, they would say they were either teachers or students or both in that system. This sphere expanded and became a power to reckon with and created a new strength to resist the Panchayat government's pressure to refrain from activities of a political nature. People like me also became part of that hegemony at some moment in time. I experienced the power of that independent culture which never accepted the Panchayat polity. Student organisations were formed, maintaining their allegiances to the major political parties that were banned. That form of hegemony gradually inspired teachers to hold free political views. I spent nearly 25 years of my half-a-century-long teaching life within that hegemony, which was a good experience. As a student, I grew with the political ideas of freedom not warranted by the autocratic regime. Later I became an independent academic. But not all the colleagues did that. They continued to be either active members or fellow travellers of the political parties. After the political change of 1990, the political parties started creating student organisations directly under their umbrellas. Today it is common to read news about the student wings affiliated to different political parties coming out in demonstrations, forming alliances and opposing measures taken by educational institutions. However, during the crucial phase of making the constitution, the political parties stated clearly that the teachers who are in service and are paid by state-funded educational institutions should not dabble in politics and become active members of political parties. That was a highly practical and insightful provision. The reason is that the Nepali educational system is on the verge of collapse because of the uncanny political interventions that could soon dethrone educational values. Politicians become alarmed at suggestions that the teachers in service should refrain from becoming political cadres. Educationists fear that political activism will lure teachers away from their roles as teachers whose responsibilities are clearly defined in their code of conduct as teachers.Intriguing question But the intriguing question is whether political parties, especially the leaders, will create conditions for a free educational environment where teachers will fulfil their responsibilities as educators who could be called the harbingers of a culture of free and creative education in Nepal. The answer to this question is not easy. It is again a Catch-22 situation. But the constitution of Nepal has guaranteed free spaces for education to function independently. The political parties and their governments cannot ignore that because Nepal's greatest hope and force in education, and it is necessary to create the condition for that to flourish. It is very easy to understand that the political parties would like to see everybody, people from all walks of life, become their party workers because they are now vying to make their groups strong. For that, they need people who are educated and have influence in the community. Teachers are the best candidates for that. But as Bertrand Russell, a British philosopher in his oeuvre about power, says one mantra, ""If you are guided by dictatorial power ambitions, you create members who are 'cogs in the machine', but if democratic values guide you, you create free people."" Such free people will decide what they want to do. They will choose what is best for them and for society and culture. The political leaders should have the courage to choose the latter in education.  "
7,Dams: Threat to big cats,https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,Dams especially in conservation areas or areas where top predators prowl should be avoided. ,"Big cats are among the most widespread top predators on Earth. Lions stalk zebra in the African savanna, tigers ambush antelope in the forests of Asia and jaguars hunt deer in the jungles of South America. They play an important role in ecosystems by regulating the numbers of these herbivores, in turn, reducing the deterioration of vegetated habitats and maintaining species diversity.Tigers, lions and jaguars must cover large areas to find food, so they need a lot of energy. As with many large carnivores, big cats are under threat from habitat loss, which leaves them with less to eat. Their spread-out populations and slow reproductive rates make them particularly vulnerable. While the habitats in which big cats live range from boreal forests at high latitudes to tropical rainforests at the equator, the causes of habitat loss are largely the same: logging for wood and fuel, plantations, farming and urbanisation.Aside from depriving wildlife of a home, forest loss also contributes to climate change. It’s ironic then that hydroelectricity, which is being developed worldwide (especially in South American and Asian countries) as an alternative energy source to fossil fuels, is a big cause of deforestation.Building hydroelectric dams has caused extinctions and spread diseases in rivers globally, but the threat to ecosystems on land has largely been overlooked. In a recent study, researchers from China and Portugal investigated how existing and planned hydroelectric dams might affect two carnivores: The near-threatened jaguar (with an estimated global population of 173,000) and the endangered tiger (thought to number between 3,200 and 3,500 worldwide).The distribution of jaguars and tigers has shrunk 50 percent and 93 percent respectively, but the researchers found that hydroelectric plants pose a substantial risk of further declines. They found 164 dams that already intersect the jaguar range and 421 dams that do the same for tigers. This equates to one in five tigers that are likely to be affected by dams, compared with one in 200 jaguars. Since tiger numbers are already so low, this could have a considerable influence on the population’s capacity to recover and may even result in local extinctions.Damning developments Large expanses of land are flooded to create reservoirs when building hydroelectric plants in low-lying, relatively flat areas. Although tigers and jaguars can and do swim, they mainly hunt species such as deer that live on land. Sites chosen for dams typically incorporate floodplains and areas along rivers that are important for both species, since they tend to contain lots of prey.The flooded area will force both predators and prey into surrounding areas. If the vegetation here can support the influx of herbivores, tigers and jaguars will probably persist. But if it cannot, the predators may be forced further afield in search of food, potentially drawing them into conflict with people who may kill them.Relatively pristine habitats are under threat. The number of hydroelectric dams is set to quadruple across the jaguar’s range with a further 429 planned, while 41 are expected where tigers roam. Aside from the direct loss of habitat, these new constructions can increase the presence of people in remote areas. Roads built to access new dam sites consequently open up areas that were previously impenetrable. Roads can be a barrier to some species and kill those that try to cross. Roads can also encourage new towns and villages, which divide the habitat further.Mitigating the damageWhere dams exist, the researchers suggest habitat loss could be limited by incorporating the surroundings into a protected area with suitable enforcement. Any new dams, though, especially in conservation areas or areas where top predators prowl, should be avoided. Sadly, most of the dams planned in Asia overlap with significant portions of the tiger’s range.One way to mitigate the damage from building new hydroelectric plants may be to do it on slopes outside of areas that are crucial for conserving tigers and jaguars. The amount of flooded area needed to produce electricity from these plants when they’re on a slope is smaller compared to those built on lower ground, reducing the overall damage to the surrounding habitat. But impact assessments would need to confirm the plant wasn’t simply creating new issues elsewhere.Alternative sources of energy are important for a sustainable future, but their benefits should not come at a substantial cost to species already under threat.—The Conversation "
8,Start jabbing,https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,Why is the government never prepared for anything that comes its way?,"The vaccines have hardly reached the poorest countries yet. For quite some time now, we have been complaining, and for a good reason, that the rich countries have hoarded more vaccines than they need, and even wasted them even as poorer countries are having a hard time administering even the first doses. The rich countries have been at the top of the vaccine hierarchy, blocking the way for the poorer and disadvantaged populations of the world even when it is clear that there is no saving the world from the pandemic unless the entire global population is vaccinated.In that sense, we in Nepal should feel lucky that we have received the vaccines, though late, and inoculated 30 percent of the eligible population fully as of now. But we seem to have arrived at a juncture where lethargy meets mismanagement on the road to vaccination. We have received a decent amount of vaccines, but a lack of sincerity on the part of the government has led to a mismatch between the number of vaccines we have received and the pace of vaccination. Clearly, we have focused more on acquiring vaccines than on administering them effectively. As the government has received more vaccines than it can administer, it is learnt to have communicated to COVAX and other vaccine providers to delay shipments. That is as irresponsible as it gets at a time when the people are waiting to be inoculated. While hoarding vaccines is unethical at a time when vaccine inequity is rising in a deeply hierarchical global world order, the inability to administer the available shots to the population that is desperately waiting to be inoculated is irresponsible, to say the least. The situation is such that we cannot even afford to hoard the vaccines even if we wish to, for we have no sufficient storage for the same.Nepal has had to store an unprecedented amount of vaccines at one go, which could have stretched the government's capacity in the beginning. But it is unintelligible how the government remains a mute spectator even when it is the one that should be taking the lead, be it in acquiring them or in storing them. While delaying the shipment is the last option we should have used so as to stop the vaccines from going to waste, there were more sensible options we could have used if officials had taken stock of the situation well in advance, and made preparations accordingly. Clearly, the problem has arisen not due to oversupply of vaccines but the government's inability to take the vaccines across the country. The best option the government has right now is to expedite vaccination of the unvaccinated so that we do not have an oversupply of the doses. At the same time, it can start administering the booster dose to the fully vaccinated so that we do not have to cut the supply chain right away for want of storage facilities.As the government maintains complete leniency on Covid-19 safety protocols and the people gather in crowds in ever increasing numbers, the risk of mass-scale transmission is very much there. We have little option but to vaccinate the entire 78 percent of the eligible population. The government must show its work in action rather than ready-made claims that it is ""working"" to expand its storage capacity. When it comes to saving the lives of the citizens, the government should have no excuse to give. "

13,Bista-inspired MMC open two-point lead at top,https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,"The captain scores twice in a 3-1 win over Police, Jawalakhel defeat Chyasal 1-0 to pull off first victory while Three Star and NRT settle for a 0-0 draw. ","Captain Anjan Bista inspired Manang Marshyangdi Club (MMC) to a 3-1 victory over Nepal Police Club as they opened a two-point lead in the Martyrs Memorial 'A' Division League standings to strengthen their bid for the AFC Cup at Pokhara Stadium on Saturday.In the first ever 'A' Division league match played outside the capital city, Nepali international winger Bista struck at both ends as MMC, who adopted Pokhara Stadium as their home ground, took advantage of the mistakes of champions Machhindra Club and the third-placed Tribhuvan Army Club — both held to draws on Friday. Substitute Nishan Limbu netted the third for MMC while Suman Lama struck for Police through penalty. With the victory over Police, MMC replaced Machhindra from the summit with 13 points from five matches. Machhindra have 11 points and Army nine points after equal matches. The team securing pole position at the end of the seventh round would be eligible to compete in the AFC Cup, the second-tier inter-country club championship of Asia.MMC and Machhindra will vie in the sixth round while the seventh round of action will see MMC taking on Brigade Boys Club and Machhindra jousting against Police.Bista broke deadlock for MMC as early as the 10th minute, capitalising on an error from Police goalie Roshan Khadka. Bista made an easy tapping after a long pass from Nepali international defender Dinesh Rajbanshi sailed over an advancing goalie Khadka, providing an easy opportunity for Bista to tap it into the unguarded net.The departmental team bounced back in the 36th through a spotkick after MMC defender Saroj Yonjan fouled forward Nir Kumar Rai inside the area. Forward Suman Lama converted the penalty, scoring his third league goal. MMC came closer to scoring three minutes later but Nigerian forward Olawale Afeez headed above the bar in Pujan Uperkoti's corner.MMC, backed by roaring home supporters, restored the lead in the 73rd with a clever freekick from Bista who slammed a low ball from the edge of the area past the defence wall. MMC were awarded a free kick after defender Santosh Hemran handed the ball.Nishan Limbu, the 60th minute replacement of Adelaja Somide, sealed the victory with the third goal in the 83rd minute. The forward quickly struck after goalie Khadka spilled Afeez's strike before Limbu fired home.Jawalakhel pull off their first victoryJawalakhel Youth Club finally ended their winless run as they grabbed their first league victory defeating Chyasal Youth Club 1-0 at the Dasharath Stadium in Tripureshwar.Indian midfielder Nicholas Fernandes scored the all important goal in the first half for Jawalakhel. Unmarked Fernandes easily converted Onguna Junior's pass to the delight of Jawalakhel fans. It was also Jawalakhel’s first goal of the league.The much required win lifted Jawalakhel out of the relegation zone, three spots up to 10th place with four points. Chyasal, who lost their game in a row, also have four points from equal five games.Jawalakhel's veteran coach Kishor KC said that the first win would definitely ease pressure on his side. ""The first win would boost the morale of the team. We failed to score in the previous matches but getting a score would be helpful in changing the mentality of players that they are capable of scoring,"" said KC.He also said that it was too early to predict which team would be relegated. ""I don't think we are a team likely to be relegated. But it would be too early to make a prediction before seven rounds of play. Hope we will play better in upcoming games,"" added KC.Chyasal coach Bal Gopal Sahukhala said that his side failed to perform in a vital clash. ""The game was important for both teams, but we conceded due to our own mistakes. The commitment of players is also getting low and we could have done much better,"" he said.Three Star, NRT share spoilsThree times champions Three Star Club and New Road Team (NRT) played to a 0-0 draw in the late fixture of the day at Dasharath Stadium.Three Star, without a victory for the fourth straight game, are joint sixth in the standings along with NRT on six points. Three Star have gone winless since a 3-0 victory over Chyasal Youth Club in their opening match and have drawn theirlast three games.Three Star's best chance of the match came in the 21st minute but striker Bijay Bhujel shot wide in a one-on-one situation with Njanga Priso.

14,"In the UML, discontent is growing as party forms committees",https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,"Some who challenged Oli are failing to find positions, others want a system to govern the organisation. ","On Friday, CPN-UML Secretary General Shanker Pokhrel announced that senior leader Bhim Rawal was appointed a member in the party’s advisory committee.Rawal, who lost to KP Sharma Oli in the party chair race in the 10th national congress of the party, was expected to be nominated either in the Standing Committee or the Central Committee.He, however, had earlier refused to become a Central Committee member. “Since Rawal is not a Central Committee member, he has not been given any responsibility in the party. A meeting of the Central Committee has decided to appoint him a member of the party advisory committee,” said Pokhrel.“Whether he should be given more responsibility in the party will be decided by the party chair.”Until another arrangement is made, Rawal will advise the party as a member of the advisory committee, according to Pokhrel.Amrit Kumar Bohora chairs the party’s advisory council.Rawal on Saturday refused to accept the position. “I have heard that I have been appointed a member of the UML advisory committee. If this is true, handpicking me without even asking me, it is objectionable,” Rawal wrote on Twitter on Saturday. “Such a trend is against the spirit of People’s Multiparty Democracy and democratic values.”Rawal is seen as an opposition in the party for standing up to party chair Oli, who bulldozed his decisions during the party’s recently concluded national congress. Despite Oli’s call for selecting the party leadership on the basis of consensus, Rawal refused to budge and filed his candidacy against the party chair. Rawal is one of the 10 leaders who once had sided with Madhav Kumar Nepal to challenge Oli. But when Nepal decided to form a new party, Rawal stayed back in the UML.Insiders say Oli is not likely to accept anyone who has challenged him in the party.“The party should run on the basis of consensus but Oli wants to run the party his way… that is the problem,” said Tanka Karki, another dissident leader in the UML, who was defeated in the party secretary election.During a recent Central Committee meeting, some leaders, including Ghanashyam Bhusal, had expressed dissatisfaction at Oli’s working style and some ideological and organisational issues.Bhusal is also among the 10 leaders to have challenged Oli in the party. The UML had gone into the convention with a promise to end factionalism and unite the party. Oli wanted everyone to be one herd following him, as his party had faced a split after the Madhav Nepal faction formed the CPN (Unified Sociliast).“I do not see any reset in the party for another four-five years. We have made the organisational structures exceptionally big. It has not become a party that can confront national and international challenges,” said Karki. “We are at a nascent phase when it comes to the party building process. On ideological and organisational fronts also, we need to do a lot of work.”Despite some opposition, Oli managed to prove that he ruled the roost in the party, all office bearers were elected as per his wish. Some of those dissidents who had challenged Oli were, however, “adjusted” after they came into Oli’s fold.In the lead up to the party’s national congress, Subas Nembang had sought the senior vice chair post but he later settled for the party vice chair.In the new order of precedence set by the party, Nembang now ranks seventh after Ram Bahadur Thapa, a former Maoist leader who joined the UML only a few months ago. Insiders said Nembang is not happy with the new set-up, especially for being ranked seventh. Nembang, however, told the Post he did not believe in such protocols and orders.“I do not give much priority to such issues,” said Nembang in a brief interview. “I am already the deputy leader of the Parliamentary Party. Ours is a democratic party.”Insiders say Oli’s core team is well aware of the fact that dissatisfaction is growing within the party. According to them, many have voiced their reservations about the way Oli picked Central Committee, Politburo and Standing Committee members.The UML formed a 99-member Politburo and 45-member Standing Committee last week.A leader who represents the dissident group said that initial signs are not good and the way Oli is building the party may have consequences, including for the next elections. Some leaders like Naresh Kharel, Dipak Prakash Bhatt, Surendra Manadhar, Yogendra Shahi and Bhaskar Kafle, among others, have failed to make it to the Central Committee. Analysts say the UML badly lacks a system and the party has become a group run by Oli. Khagendra Prasai, assistant professor at Kathmandu University, said that Oli is not running the party as a chair but he is acting more like the head of a clique.“I do not even consider the 10th national congress as a convention of a communist party. The convention just reestablished Oli. That is why Oli is systematically sidelining his dissidents in the party,” said Prasai.Discontent in Oli’s party began after he started working unilaterally, ignoring the party system when he was the chair of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) which was formed after a merger between the UML and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre).Over two thirds of the Standing Committee members last year had sought his resignation as prime minister and put Oli in a fix. After finding himself cornered, Oli on December 20 dissolved the House of Representatives. Later in March this year, the Supreme Court invalidated the NCP and revived the UML and the Maoist Centre.But Oli faced opposition from yet another group in the UML—by the Madhav Nepal faction. After Nepal decided to part ways and form his own party, Oli emerged as the numero uno leader in the UML. Oli supporters, however, say things are fine in the UML. “We held such a successful convention to democratically elect a new leadership. If some people are not happy, it does not matter,” said Bishnu Rijal, deputy chief of the party’s Publicity Department. “There are no discords and differences in the party, as reported outside. In the case of Rawal, he was not ready for nomination in either the Standing Committee or the Central Committee. As far as Nembang is concerned, he was not an office bearer in the party earlier. It’s wrong to say that the party is not following the system and leaders are unhappy.” "
