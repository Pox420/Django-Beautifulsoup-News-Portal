1,Beding linked with national electricity grid,https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,Rs30 million was spent to supply power to the village by installing 390 electricity poles. ,"Beding village in the remote northern part of Dolakha district has been linked with the national transmission line.The Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) constructed a 24-km-long transmission line of 11KV from Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project’s powerhouse to supply electricity to the village. According to the NEA, a budget of Rs 30 million was spent to supply electricity to the village by installing 390 utility poles.“Our village was left behind when it came to development because we did not have electricity supply,” said Nawang Tenji Lama, a local resident. “Now that we are connected to the national transmission line, we hope we will get an uninterrupted supply of electricity.”The villagers have been relying on solar and oil lamps as the local micro hydropower has remained closed for the past 10 years. Although the village had a telecom network via Nepal Telecom, it wasn’t of much use without electricity, say locals. The locals, however, remain sceptical. They question the durability of the utility poles installed for electricity transmission. “We receive heavy rainfall every year. I’m not sure if the poles are erected properly,” said Lama. “I’m afraid we will be back in darkness if the weather turns bad.” Lama says the contractor did not do a thorough job of erecting the utility poles in the village. “They have placed some utility poles in the middle of the foot trail along the Rolwaling stream. We had submitted a memorandum to the NEA asking them not to install the electricity poles on the foot trail but our request was not addressed,” said Lama.Beding village, which lies at ward 9 of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality, is around 80 km north from Charikot, the district headquarters of Dolakha. The village is not even connected with the national road network. There are 85 households of Sherpa and Tamang communities in the village that lies at an altitude of 3,721 metres above sea level.“We never thought our village would be linked to the national grid. It is a huge achievement for the development of this remote village. But we are worried whether the electricity line can sustain harsh weather conditions,” said Tsering Sherpa, the ward chairman of Gaurishankar-9.The expansion of the electricity line to the village has been completed and the NEA is now installing transformers. “Insulator wires have been used to connect the village to the national grid. We will soon transport two transformers to the village. Electricity supply will reach the village in about two weeks now,” said Meghnath Dhakal, chief at the Dolakha distribution centre of the NEA. According to Dhakal, it was a challenge to connect the village to the national grid since most of the equipment, wires and utility poles had to be transported to the village by porters. Addressing the locals’ concerns about the durability of the utility poles and the contractor’s work, Dhakal said technicians from NEA will soon make a field visit to the village to monitor the quality of work being done.“The electricity line has reached the village. We will ask the contractor to remove utility poles from the middle of the foot trail so that they won’t inconvenience locals and tourists alike,” he said. Beding lies along the Tsho-Rolpa trekking route in Rolwaling valley and is a tourist destination.  "
2,Congress is broken. It needs fixing,https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,An overhauled ideology—and an organisational rejig—is a must to inject new blood into the grand old party. ,"On Sunday, Nepali Congress leader Sher Bahadur Deuba urged the general convention delegates to vote for him in the party president election.“If I lose, everyone will create a ruckus… they will say how can someone who lost the party president post will govern the country,” said Deuba, who is also the prime minister leading a five-party coalition. “If I win the party presidency, this coalition will continue… until the next elections.”Deuba, who leads the establishment faction in the party, is not only eying a repeat as party president but also yet another stint—sixth—as prime minister after the elections next year.Four days ago, on Thursday, Gagan Thapa, a Congress youth leader, organised an event at Nepal Academy. In a jam-packed hall, Thapa, 46, made public his political document—a roadmap for the party, for the country. He has outlined some immediate measures for the next one year until the elections and long-term steps that the party should take for the next five years.Thapa is contesting for party general secretary from the anti-establishment faction.In his document, Thapa has said the party has almost given up the tradition of ideological discussions and debates.“Even while taking important decisions in the party, wider discussions are rarely held,” reads the document. “Nor are there any debates on the decisions.”Thapa appears to be clear why debates and discussions on a wide range of issues—political, social, economic, organisational—are a must in a party.Party insiders and observers say how Deuba and Thapa, who represent two different generations, view the ongoing convention—what they want to achieve—shows the stark reality of today's Congress. According to them, time has come for the party to transform.But for that the party needs an idea. It needs principles and programmes. It has to set goals.How the Nepali Congress, founded in 1947 with lucid principles and goals, became a party without an idea then?One of the most revered leaders of the party, the late BP Koirala, had laid down the principles and programmes for the Nepali Congress. Democratic socialism was the goal.The Congress still harps on nationalism, democracy and socialism, but ever since the restoration of democracy in 1990, it appears to have done precious little to make its members—and the public— aware of the essence of its idea and the core values of the party.After the restoration of democracy in 1990, Nepali Congress came to power. But none of the leaders carried forward the party’s principles. Leaders engaged in power politics. Factionalism ruled the roost. After getting frustrated at groupism and power politics, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, known as an austere leader, who held the party’s values and principles close to his heart, decided to detach himself from the Congress. He led the party from January 1988 to January 1992. The last two years of his leadership saw the country transition into democracy from Panchayat. The late Ganesh Man Singh who gave his whole life to the party never held any office of profit. Nor did he run for party president. His son Prakash Man Singh is currently pitted against Deuba, Shekhar Koirala and Bimalendra Nidhi. Like Singh, both Koirala and Nidhi have their own family legacies—the former is the nephew of the late BP Koirala and the latter is the son of Congress stalwart Mahendra Narayan Nidhi. Subsequent leaders helmed the Congress—Girija Prasad Koirala (three times from 1992 to 2010) and Sushil Koirala (from 2010 to2016)—barely gave priority to party ideologies. Many may ascribe that lacking to political upheavals—a decade of Maoist insurgency from 1996 to 2006 and constitution drafting from 2008 to 2015.Deuba, who won the party president post in March 2016 general convention, is known as a leader who dared to challenge the Koiralas. He holds a solid political background—coming from student politics, Deuba rose through the ranks over the years to lead the party. Holding the prime minister’s office for a fifth time may easily find its place in history books as an achievement. But Deuba has never been known as a leader who prioritises party principles and ideologies.Over the years, those at the party helm continued to propagate the idea: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”Analysts say the grand old party by and large for decades has fed on “BP’s dreams,” whatever that meant for the party members or the public. As the Congress is holding its 14th general convention, it is standing at a crossroads. A revised ideological line and an organisational overhaul is a must in the party, say analysts and insiders.Except for Thapa, none of the leaders contesting for various posts, however, have floated any concrete plans as to how they want to steer the party and the country. Not even Shekhar Koirala, the party president aspirant, from whose panel Thapa is contesting for general secretary.“In Nepal’s politics, Nepali Congress is just not a party organisation, it is an idea. It is a campaign,” Thapa says in his 60-page document. “By virtue of being one of the oldest parties and a force that led various changes in the country, the direction taken by the Nepali Congress defines the path for the country.”The party, adds Thapa, hence, through this convention, must draw up an ideological framework and political roadmap for 2021-2025.Observers say it’s unfortunate that senior Nepali Congress leaders have neither time nor energy to read and discuss Thapa’s proposal. The Congress has said the party will hold its “policy convention” to discuss its ideology, principles and goals. No date has been fixed yet.Indra Bahadur Gurung, 83, from Syangja has been a long-time Congress member, who has formerly been in the party Central Working Committee. “The party’s broken and it must be fixed,” said Gurung, who is in Kathmandu to vote to elect a new leadership. He is one of the 4,743 delegates that will elect 13 office bearers and 134 Central Working Committee members. “But I am not convinced whoever comes to the leadership will be able to transform the party.”Gurung believes there is a serious dearth of leaders who actually care for the party. “I am not happy with the youth leaders also because of the way they are switching sides just to win the election,” he said. But many say there is a whiff of change this time, as quite some youth leaders have entered the fray challenging the old faces.Gagan Thapa, Bishwa Prakash Sharma and Pradip Poudel, among others, who came from student politics, especially after the 1990’s political change, have inspired hopes.The party, however, can elect only two general secretaries.“Not everything is lost as yet. There is hope,” said Shankar Tiwari, 37, a candidate for the Central Working Committee. “Since the 12th convention the younger generation has started challenging the older generation.”Tiwari agrees that the party is in dire need of transformation. His recently published book is titled “Who will fix the Congress?”, in an indication that the party is indeed broken.“Whoever wins the two general secretary posts, the party will get young blood,” said Tiwari.In the Congress, the general secretary post is considered the most powerful after the party president, even though it has two vice president posts.Shree Krishna Aniruddha Gautam, a political commentator who has followed Congress and national politics for years, says the grand old party does need transformation, but the party leaders first need to diagnose the problem.“Everyone seems to have forgotten the foundation… the basis on which the party was constituted,” Gautam told the Post. “A renewed and vigorous debate is required to give the party a new direction in the changed context. What are the goals of the party? How does it want to achieve these goals? What are its principles?”To diagnose the problem, according to Gautam, the party needs to assess itself first.Complacency could be yet another reason why the Nepali Congress has not discussed its plans, programmes and policies. Since 1990, the party has managed to remain in power for most of the years.The 2017 election results, however, were shocking. The party faced a spectacular defeat. Fighting against the communist behemoth—the CPN-UML and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) had formed an alliance—Congress could secure just 23 seats out of the 165 positions up for grabs under the direct election system, under Deuba’s leadership.The party, however, never tried to hold any extensive discussions to find out why it lost. Deuba refused to stand down as party president. “It’s a shame that the Congress is still not paying attention to some fundamentals,” said Daman Nath Dhungana, a civil society leader who actively participated in both people’s movements in 1990 and 2006. “Transformation of the Congress party will be incomplete until it finds ways to address the challenges faced by the country and meet the expectations of the people,” added Dhungana who had contested the 2017 parliamentary elections on a Congress ticket but lost.Over the years, the Congress party has lost touch with the people, even its own members, say some old party hands.Sanat Kumar Mandal, 52, is in Kathmandu to participate in the party’s general convention.“I have been with the party for the last 34 years and served in different committees,” said Mandal from Siraha. “But my party does not behave like a democratic party anymore. The mighty and powerful bulldoze decisions. Nepotism is rife. I don’t think the people these days, despite being supporters of the party, can connect to the Congress.”According to Mandal, it’s high time the party bade farewell to old faces and gave a chance to youths to steer the party.“It would be better for the party to revise its statute and put an age-limit so that new blood and fresh ideas could be brought in,” said Mandal. “The party leadership should stop pitching abstract ideas and get down to real business. Transformation starts from the grassroots. First and foremost, the party needs to re-establish its connection with the people. If there are no people, there is no party.” "
3,Tourism boom in tri-city area in central Tarai loses steam after Covid-19,https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png,The anticipated resurgence has been excruciatingly slow with tourist arrivals still 80 percent below 2019 levels. ,"Butwal, Bhairahawa and Lumbini were on the way to becoming Nepal's second largest cities after Kathmandu with the way the hospitality industry was flourishing in this tri-city area in the central Tarai.More than 10,000 jobs have opened in the hotel sector since construction work began on a new international airport in Bhairahawa, which will be the second one in the country after the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu.Then Covid-19 pandemic swept in and everything fell apart.Sujit Gaha of Syangja, an experienced chef currently working at Faze Restaurant & Cafe in Bhairahawa, will not be getting a raise for months—or even years—until the industry returns to normal.He, currently, earns Rs40,000 monthly, and is not satisfied with the salaries the hotels and restaurants are paying their skilled workers.“It is difficult to get skilled people,” said Gaha. “The low pay has been causing a massive brain drain.”Gaha had completed a chef training course at the Kantipur Hotel Training Centre in Pokhara, Kaski in 2010, and set out as an intern without a salary to get hands-on experience. Now he has become a skilled chef.The coronavirus pandemic spoiled everything.The tourism industry bore the brunt of the virus when arrivals sank to all-time lows, and travel traders have been desperately looking for signs of a revival. But the anticipated resurgence has been excruciatingly slow with tourist arrivals still 80 percent below 2019 levels.After the second Covid-19 wave hit Nepal in April, the country slid into a devastating crisis with the authorities enforcing strict lockdown measures. About two months later, the restrictions were relaxed gradually, and since September 1, almost everything has been allowed to reopen.Subsequently, Nepal saw the highest post-Covid monthly arrivals in October, pushing the total number since the start of the year past the 100,000 mark.According to data released by the Nepal Tourism Board, Nepal welcomed 23,284 foreign tourists by air in October.The number, however, did not improve as expected despite the full-fledged reopening.In November, the country’s peak tourism season, there were 26,487 arrivals. According to the board, in the 11 months of 2021, Nepal received just over 126,000 tourists.And now the Omicron scare has kept the world on tenterhooks. The new iteration of the coronavirus, which the World Health Organisation says has spread to 57 countries, has emerged as a cause for concern for Nepal’s tourism sector as well. The sluggish revival coupled with the Omicron threat has eroded the prospects of hospitality industry workers getting their jobs back.In Bhairahawa, too, despite many properties being developed, hiring has not picked up after a long lull. There is a shortage of skilled manpower, but the industry is not much worried. Tara Chaudhary of Kailali has been working at Siddhartha Cottage in Butwal for five years. He had completed two years of hotel management training and was hired at Siddhartha Cottage in Tikapur, Kailali.""Initially, I had to wipe and clean the hotel floor,” he said. After a long struggle, he is now a captain in-charge (restaurant manager) at the hotel. He urges aspiring workers to get training before joining the profession. As the hotel industry is expanding in the once sleepy city of Bhairahawa following the construction of the second international airport, which has been named Gautam Buddha International Airport as it has been styled as the gateway to Lumbini, a wave of a new generation of entrepreneurs is coming.There is a huge demand for skilled workers along with the growth in infrastructure.New cafés and restaurants are popping up in every nook and cranny. Nearly a dozen luxury hotels are being launched in Bhairahawa. Tourism was largely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Some hotels and restaurants were forced to lay off skilled workers. Skilled workers are migrating abroad, according to hotel entrepreneurs.Ram Prasad Gautam, president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association in Rupandehi, said that the sector was experiencing a shortage of skilled manpower due to the pandemic. ""Normally, large hotels employ more than 50 workers each, but it has been difficult to retain them,"" he said. ""Salaries range from Rs15,000 to Rs100,000 monthly, depending on experience."" Gautam said that they had made arrangements to provide training to workers by involving the Restaurant and Bar Association, Rupandehi which has more than 25 restaurants as members.Sagar Poudyal, vice-president of the association, said these restaurants currently employ 15 workers each. The 46 hotels affiliated to the Siddhartha Hotel Association in Bhairahawa together employ nearly 3,500 people. There are 110 hotels affiliated with the Lumbini Hotel Association which provided jobs to 3,500 people before the pandemic. Now, there are only 1,500 workers at the hotels.Govinda Gyawali, president of the association, said a large number of hotels had still not reopened, and this had indirectly affected thousands of jobs. Investors are making big investments in Bhairahawa. The hotels and restaurants that were gradually recovering from the Covid disaster have started to panic following reports of the emergence of new variants. In a bid to lessen the risk of an outbreak of Omicron the Ministry of Health and Population has recommended a mandatory seven-day quarantine for all people returning from abroad.Industry insiders say amid the uncertainty, they don’t see the revival of the sector anytime soon.“Young people want to learn and enjoy working in restaurants,” said Poudyal, the vice president of the Restaurant and Bar Association, Rupandehi. “But the number of workers joining the industry and quitting is about equal, and this has been a continuous process.” "
